# About the Project

- I have divided the page in some sections and further each section in some reusable components.
- The week portion is real time, i.e. on change of day, it'll show real time update.
- I have tried to keep the design of the page according to the provided design.
- I have tried to increase the reusability and modularity of the project as much as possible.
